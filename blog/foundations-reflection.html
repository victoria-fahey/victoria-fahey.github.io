        <h3 class="blog-heading-3">three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>I didn’t realise until going through the core exercises that I inherently have a growth mindset. I have never taken failure or obstacles as a roadblock and that I can eventually achieve what I want it just might take longer but I’ll eventually get there.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The core learning has also taught me to nurture and take care of my own mind better, to check in and be kind with yourself.</li>
                <br>
                <li>As someone who doesn’t really like to share and express my emotions especially to strangers, this core learning journey has given me a good chance to self-reflect and force my ego to let go and embrace the core challenges.</li>

        <h3 class="blog-heading-3">The role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            Values play a huge role in learning and programming as everyone’s personal values are different and is the make-up of who we are as individual human beings, because who you are and what you value will dictate how you learn. This is also important to programming but more so in the context of working with others, which leads to the importance of empathy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Having empathy and emotional intelligence is important for all aspects of one’s life but it also plays a significant role in the workplace. Being able to understand and manage your own as well as other’s emotion is an extremely powerful tool to be able to succeed and communicate effectively in the workplace. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Mastering empathy and knowing one’s own values requires a level of self-awareness, which in my opinion is the greatest human skill to have. To be self-aware of your own strengths and weaknesses will help you become a better learner and programmer as it will allow you to focus on areas where you might need to do extra work on. This is also the same for your mental and physical wellbeing, having self-awareness and knowing when to check in and look after yourself will also benefit you in learning and working as a programmer.

        <h3 class="blog-heading-3">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            I’d like to think I have become more self-aware over the years coming into my late 20’s, so I was surprised that going through the core learning has added another level of self-awareness. I guess it just goes to show that you can never stop learning about yourself and evolving into a better self. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="blog-heading-3">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            As an introvert I don’t really enjoy sharing my emotions, thoughts, or reaching out to strangers for help, so core learning has really challenged me to get out of my comfort zone in this aspect to reach out and ask for help or ask someone from my cohort to practice looping/listening or pair program with. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="blog-heading-3">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            I think it’s great that DEV Academy has put a lot of emphasis on core learning, because these human skills are going to be what makes you employable in the real world. Anyone can learn to code and program but not everyone has the social tools to be able to have emotional intelligence or self-awareness to be a team player in the workplace. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only are these human skills important in the workplace, but these skills will also be transferable during our bootcamp and learning. The importance of having a growth mindset and self-awareness while you’re learning will especially help in learning something new like programming. And having emotional intelligence will help when we start to work with other people in our cohorts. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="blog-heading-3">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            No, I feel like it hasn’t been a waste of time, and I even like how the core learning has been taught in the form of these blogs, where we are still technically practicing our programming skills by creating them in HTML and CSS.
