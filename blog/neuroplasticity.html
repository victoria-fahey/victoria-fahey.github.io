        <h3 class="blog-questions">What is neuroplasticity & how does it benefit people?</h3>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is defined as the brains ability to modify, change, and adapt both structure and function throughout life and in response to experiences. It is the understanding that our brains are malleable and through repeated practice and experiences, anyone can learn anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding this concept that our brains are not just static provides many benefits, it allows your brain to adapt and change which can help influence:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The ability to learn new things</li>
                <li>The ability to enhance your existing cognitive capabilities</li>
                <li>Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries</li>
                <li>Strengthening areas if some functions are lost or in decline </li>
                <li>Improvements that can promote brain fitness</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-questions">How will you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h3>
        <p>
            So far I have enjoyed learning and researching the principles of neuroplasticity. Not only does it add another level of self-awareness, but the power of knowing that my own brain is more than capable of anything I literally put my mind to will definitely benefit me in all aspects of my life. Most importantly right now on this learning journey at Dev Academy, understanding neuroplasticity is going to be a great tool in building self-confidence and motivation that I can come out of this as a web developer.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-questions">What are some ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
            Luckily for us, there are things we can do to help encourage our brain to adapt and change and to increase our neuroplasticity. These include:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enriching your environment – introducing focused attention, novelty and challenge has been shown to stimulate positive changes in the brain. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learning something new such as a new language, instrument, or even coding &#128521;</li>
                        <li>Travelling & exploring new places</li>
                        <li>Getting creative</li>
                        <li>Reading</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Getting plenty of rest – sleep plays an important role of growth in the brain and strengthens neural connections</li>
                <li>Exercise</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practice makes Perfect<br></span>
            the more times the network is stimulated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes

        <hr>
        <br>
        <h3 class="blog-questions">What is growth mindset & why is it relevant?</h3>
        <p>
            Mindset is used to describe the way people think about their own ability and talent. These can be categorised as either a fixed or growth mindset. A <span style="color: orangered;">fixed mindset</span> is the belief that your basic abilities, intelligence, and talent are fixed traits that are unchangeable. Whereas, a <span style="color:dodgerblue">growth mindset</span> is the power of believing you can improve and your ability can be developed.
        </p>
        <p>
            A growth mindset is extremely relevant to learning as it allows you to overcome obstacles and failure you may face when learning something new or developing a new skill. Growth mindsets understand the importance of persistence and determination. For example, when faced with a challenging problem to solve, someone with a fixed mindset may give up easily as they don’t believe they have the smarts to overcome this problem. Whereas a growth mindset may see this as an opportunity for improvement where they can solve the problem, just not yet.
        </p>

            By changing the way you think, you can change the way you learn

        <h3 class="blog-heading-3">My learning plan & neuroplasticity / growth mindset</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            After having a read over my learning plan again, I have decided to add neuroplasticity and growth mindset as human skills I want to develop during my time at Dev Academy. This exploration on neuroplasticity and growth mindset has really made me appreciate the power of the brain, and that with some dedication and practice you can really do anything you set your mind to. I understand that developing a growth mindset isn’t going to be easy, and it’ll mean I will have to change my self-narrative and inner critic but I look forward to embracing new challenges and failures during this course as opportunities to grow. During this exploration I also realised how neuroplasticity and growth mindset blend together as you can’t have one without the other. Because for growth mindset to occur you also need to open up your brain and embrace a new way of thinking through practice and repetition.
