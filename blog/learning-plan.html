            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>My long term goal is to become a proficient enough web developer so that I can bring these skills into my current managing position at a NGO and use it to update our company’s website as well as potentially using these skills in developing tools for coral reef research.</p>
            <p>Since I am also “stuck” in New Zealand at the moment, I also hope to freelance or get short-term work in the web development field before I move back overseas to continue my work.</p>

            <h3 class="blog-heading-3">Non-technical/human skill development</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>I’d like to further develop my communication skills, especially interpersonally and developing the confidence to communicate my ideas and thoughts. I’d also like to develop my decision making/time management skills in terms of deciding when to move on with a task instead of getting caught up in the small details.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="blog-heading-3">My commitment to managing the workload in this programme</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>I commit to working productively and safely with my fellow cohort, facilitators and industry/community representatives by being respectful of others and holding myself accountable for my actions and behaviours. In order to ensure productivity and managing the workload, I will commit to meeting deadlines set by both myself and those set by Dev Academy, and if for whatever reason I cannot make these deadlines I will commit to expressing this to my facilitator in advance for potential extensions.</p>
            <p>If the workload begins to build up and I cannot handle the pressure I will commit to reaching out and expressing this to  either my facilitator, family and friends. I will also commit to keeping my mental health in check by taking breaks, staying active and being kind to myself along this learning journey.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="blog-heading-3">My commitment to how & where to seek help</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>If I need help, I commit to first spending time on researching what I need help with (e.g. google), and if I cannot achieve this I will reach out to the community on slack, and if this does not answer my question I will reach out to my facilitator in our weekly catch ups.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="blog-heading-3">My expectation from the facilitation team</h3>

            <br>
            <p>My expectations from the facilitation team is to offer support, guidance and motivation in a respectful and timely manner.</p>
