            <strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of the action you took. </strong>

        <p>
            I used to work as a dive instructor in Thailand and I had a group of students who had come to the island for a few days to learn how to SCUBA dive. The island I lived on was also famous for the Full Moon Party, and one thing that doesn’t mix well with diving is excessive partying. So, the first couple of days go by and all is going well with the Open Water course, we only had a couple of dives left before I could sign them off as open water divers. On the last day, I had found out that my students had partied a little too hard at the Full Moon Party, and as a dive instructor I inherently have duty of care both legally and ethically. So, the decision I had to make was to either let them continue and finish the course (since they didn’t have any time left to just leave it for the next day), which means I get paid a bonus from my employer, the dive school gets paid in full and my students get their certification, or to refuse to take them diving which means they don’t get their certification and have to do it elsewhere on their travels, my employer doesn’t get paid in full which means I also don’t get paid. In the end, I decided that no amount of money is worth risking the lives of others for the sake of a paycheck or disrupting someone’s holiday. Unfortunately, the dive school I worked for only cared about pumping out the certifications and subsequently I was given less students as “punishment” for making what I believe to be the only right decision there could have been.

            <strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            My cultural identity is a bit of a mixed one, quite literally, I am half Singaporean (of Malay descent) on my mother’s side and half Pākehā (of Irish descent) on my father’s side. Having families from two different cultures has allowed me to be culturally aware and sensitive of others from all walks of life. Although having a mixed cultural identity can sometimes be perceived as a negative, where you aren’t quite one or the other, I believe it has given me the self-confidence to go against the grain and pave my own way through life.

            <strong>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I think all of my strengths will help me on my learning journey and help me overcome obstacles. But what I am more excited about is how this learning journey will help me flip my self-perceived limitations upside down and turn them into strengths.

        <p class="p-blog-questions">
            <strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I work for a very small NGO in Thailand (stuck in NZ cause of COVID) where I have a leadership role. Before COVID, we were trying to implement new changes and more structure into the way we work, and I was met with resistance to change from one of my colleagues. Being a women and relatively new to leadership at the time I thought the solution was to be more overtly assertive and match my male counterparts. Even though this worked at the time, I now realise I could have approached this situation differently by having an open, honest conversation with my colleague about why they may have been feeling resistance to change and channelling these human skills more.
